*Added a 'Details' button to the server window to display server greeting and capability text.
*Configurable columns (as in mailbox window) allow state, mailbox name, total, recent, and unseen message number, and a button for favourite mailboxes to be displayed. State and message number columns only display data after the mailbox has been opened or checked (either manually or automatically).

-Mailboxes
*Now uses a separate connection for each open mailbox.
*'Check Mail' command now checks for mail in active mailbox window, or selected mailboxes in server window, or just INBOX.
*Added support for display of Mailbox properties via 'Properties…' menu item in 'Edit' menu. This will display a dialog with three panels, including quota & ACL information, and allow suitable information to be changed.
*Added 'Check Favourites' menu item to Mailbox menu. 'Check Mail' now means check the currently selected mailboxes in the server window or the mailbox of the top mailbox window. 'Check Favourites' will check the set of mailboxes with 'Check for New Mail' on in the Mailbox properties.

*Support for remote preferences via IMSP. Preferences dialog has new 'Remote' panel as well as 'Local' and 'Remote' buttons to allow saving to local disk or remote server.

-Remote Address Books
*Added support for IMSP remote address books (including ACLs). The 'Address' preferences panel has been changed to allow setup of multiple remote address book servers which can use different protocols (IMSP & LDAP for now, ACAP when available).
*A new 'Address Book Manager' window has been created and the main menu bar reorganised with an 'Addresses' menu to help managing local and remote address book services. Window can be closed (which just hides it) to save screen space.
*'Properties' command on address books allows particular address books to be opened at startup, used for nick-name resolution and used for searching. Each of these can be set separately.

-Address Book Searching
*Local and remote address books can now be searched. A new 'Address Search' window is available that allows you to type in a single search criterion and to choose a search method (currently 'Mulberry Address Books' or 'LDAP'). Search results are then presented in the table. The addresses in the results can be used to address a new message, or copied to a new message or an address book.
*Basic LDAP lookup now supported by configuring an LDAP account in Address preferences. You need to specify a root location for the search as well as entering attribute values to associate with Mulberry address entries.

-Styled Text: Viewing
*Viewing of text/enriched and text/html now supported.

*Default composition style is set in preferences.
*Toolbar appears above text display area in draft window to aid styled composition.
*Can configure Mulberry to automatically generate multpart/alternative if composing enriched or HTML message (this even includes the ability to create three sub-parts for all three supported formats).

-Multiple Identities
*Support for multiple identities for sending mail. These can be added via a new prefs panel. Identities can then be chosen using a new popup menu in the draft window.

-Miscellaneous
*Forwarding and bouncing of messages now includes the whole message as a message/rfc822 part so all attachments get sent.
*Send Again will recreate the whole original message (including all parts) and allow editing of text parts.
*Draft messages on the server are opened into a new draft window as per Send Again, making template email messages easy to use.
*Mulberry will now give the choice of acting on all items together or on each item separately when more than one message is selected in a mailbox window. This operation applies to: saving (all messages saved to a single file), forwarding, replying.
*Added 'Create Digest' command to create multipart/digest based on selected messages in mailbox window.

Minor Changes

-Server Window
*Dragging messages to a mailbox window or a mailbox in the server window now uses a single copy command for all messages to be copied, rather than one copy command per message.
*Typing a tab in the server window will select the next mailbox with recent messages.

-Mailbox WIndow
*Will not allow a mailbox window to be closed if a message (or a part of a message) is being used in a draft (i.e. a reply or a draft with an attached message part).

-Miscellaneaous
*Added 'Save Password' option to prefs.
*Multi-user preferences can be configured to prevent passwords saved in prefs file.
*Multi-user preferences can be configured to force the return address domain to always be that specified in the multi-user prefs. Network panel entry is locked out as well.

*Holding down the control key while copying a message will toggle the state of the 'Delete after Copy' option.
*During a drag operation, the arrow cursor will display a '+' symbol when the operation will result in a 'copy' as opposed to a 'move' (copy and delete original) action.

*'Choose' directory button now works in 'Attachments' prefs panel.
